# Colophon
I wanted very much to keep this website simple, both in functionality and in design. Typography (and, for that matter, pagination) on the web has improved so much in recent years that it seemed a shame to do anything more.

To that end, the HTML for this site is statically generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) while [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) hosts the files. 

Credit for the responsive grid belongs to [Toast](http://daneden.me/toast/). The type is set in Adobe's excellent (and open source) [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe/Source-Sans-Pro) and served via [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts). I arrived at the colors by fiddling with [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/).
