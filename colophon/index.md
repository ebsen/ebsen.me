# Colophon
I wanted very much to keep this website simple, both in functionality and in design. Typography (and, for that matter, pagination) on the web has improved so much in recent years. It seemed a shame to do anything else.

To that end, this site is statically generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). **Somewhere** provides the hosting. Credit for the responsive grid belongs to [Toast](http://daneden.me/toast/).
