<h1 id="hello">
	Hello
</h1>
<p>
	I am a Christian, a husband, and a father. I try to keep them in that order.
</p>
<p>
	While I double-majored in journalism and English literature, these days I write mostly in Objective-C, in which I develop software for iPhone and iPad.
</p>
<p>
	When I have time, I enjoy <a href="http://github.com/eriklebsen">tinkering</a> with Ruby and the more Unix-y aspects of OS X, especially the command line. I am fascinated by the linguistic intersection between &#8220;human&#8221; language and source code. Blame the English major.
