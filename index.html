	<h1 id="hello">Hello</h1>

	<p>I am a Christian, a husband, and a father. I try to keep them in that order.</p>

	<p>While I double-majored in English literature and mass communications, my writing these days consists mostly of Objective-C, in which I develop software for iPhone and iPad.</p>

	<p>When I have time, I enjoy <a href="http://github.com/eriklebsen">tinkering</a> with Ruby and the more Unix-y aspects of OS X, especially the command line. I am fascinated by the linguistic intersection between &#8220;human&#8221; language and source code. Blame the English major.</p>
