		Hello
	</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Erik Ebsen. I am a Christian, a husband, and a father.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wrote this little website to experiment with aspects of web development like responsive grids, HTML5 tags, web fonts, and static pages.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed coding it.

		About
	</h1>
	<p>
		When I have time, I enjoy <a href="http://github.com/eriklebsen">tinkering</a> with Ruby and the more Unix-y aspects of OS X, especially the command line. I am fascinated by the linguistic intersection between &#8220;human&#8221; language and source code. Blame the English major.
