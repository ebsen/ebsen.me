# README
I wrote this (very, very) simple web page as a placeholder for [ebsen.me/][1] Eventually, I really do plan to do something more significant with the address.

The CSS is based on [Dan Eden][2]'s wonderfully flexible [Toast][3], which I recommend.

Colors for the site came from fiddling around&mdash;_forever!_&mdash;with [Color Scheme Designer][3]. As you can tell, it could use a little more fiddling. A designer I am not.

# Licence
This project is released under the (apparently British) [â˜º Licence][license], which, coincidentally, is the license Mr. Eden uses for Toast. So it seemed fitting to use that license here as well.
