# README
I wrote this (very, very) simple web page as a placeholder for [ebsen.me/][1]. Eventually, I really do plan to do something more significant with the address.

The CSS is based on [Dan Eden][2]'s wonderfully flexible [Toast][3]. Colors for the site came from fiddling around with [Color Scheme Designer][3].
