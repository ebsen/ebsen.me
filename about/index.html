		This website uses all the new shenanigans I can wrap my head around (a responsive grid, HTML5, and web fonts, for instance) and little else. It is an experiment that I hope you enjoy viewing as much as I enjoyed coding.

		While I double-majored in journalism and English literature, these days I write mostly in Objective-C, in which I develop software for iPhone and iPad.

		When I have time, I enjoy <a href="http://github.com/eriklebsen">tinkering</a> with Ruby and the more Unix-y aspects of OS X, especially the command line. I am fascinated by the linguistic intersection between &#8220;human&#8221; language and source code. Blame the English major.
