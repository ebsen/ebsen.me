	<p>My undergraduate years taught me literature, essay writing, and story hunting. These days, I read programming manuals, write Objective-C, and hunt algorithms.</p>
	<p>I am fascinated by the juncture of &#8220;human&#8221; and &#8220;programming&#8221; languages. I genuinely <em>like</em> Objective-C and&#8212;although I hardly get to use it&#8212;Ruby.</p>
