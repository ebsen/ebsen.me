	<p>While my undergraduate years taught me literature, writing, and hunting a story, these days I read mostly programming manuals, I write mostly in Objective-C, and I hunt mostly for the root of silly build errors.</p>
	<p>When I have time, I like playing around with Ruby, delving into the Unix underbelly of OS X, and pondering the intersection of &#8220;programming&#8221; and &#8220;human&#8221; languages.</p>
