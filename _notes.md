# TODO
* Collapse `Professional` into the `Projects` page
* Fix the navigation, either by left-aligning the list items or scrapping the whole "let's make that a grid" thing
* Fix the missing bullets from body-copy list items in "tiny screen" size
* Have Harmony proof the copy
* Include Source Code Pro for the `code` references
* Investigate a left- or right-aligned column navigation
* Get this thing hosted...somewhere
