<p>
	I have done several kinds of work, including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>develop farm-management software for the iOS platform</li>
	<li>manage, edit, and write web content for a large Midwestern university</li>
	<li>assist university faculty to make better use of classroom technology</li>
	<li>design brochures for a state education department</li>
	<li>edit a college newspaper</li>
</ul>

	Intermingled through these, I help out on the family farm/ranch.
