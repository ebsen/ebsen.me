	<p>I have done several kinds of work, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>develop <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/sdsu-agbio-communications/id369421340">farm-management applications</a> for iOS</li>
		<li>manage, edit, and write web content for a large Midwestern university</li>
		<li>assist university faculty to make better use of classroom technology</li>
		<li>design brochures for a state education department</li>
		<li>edit a college newspaper</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Intermingled through these, I help out on the family farm/ranch.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m an <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/alumni/erik">alumnus of the Pragmatic Studio for iOS</a>.</p>
	<p>Prior to that, I completed the <a href="http://catalog.sdstate.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=2763&returnto=1320">core course requirements of the Computer Science minor</a> from South Dakota State University with a GPA of 4.0.</p>
	<p>Prior to <em>that</em>, I earned two Bachelor of Arts degrees from the same university: one in journalism, the other in English literature. (I am still recovering from these. It&#8217;s a battle every day.)</p>
