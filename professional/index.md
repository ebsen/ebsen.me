# Professional History
I have done many kinds of work, including:

- develop farm-management software for the iOS platform
- manage, edit, and write web content for a large Midwestern university
- assist university faculty to make better use of classroom technology
- design brochures for a state education department
- edit a college newspaper

Intermingled through these, I help out on the family farm/ranch.

I graduated from South Dakota State University in 2008 with Bachelor of Arts degrees in English Literature and in News-Editorial Journalism with a GPA of 3.x.

In addition, I have three college-level courses in C++ up through Data Structures with a GPA of 4.0
