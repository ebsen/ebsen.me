# About Me
I am a young--although not *that* young--Christian, husband, and father.

While I double-majored in English literature and mass communications, my writing these days consists almost entirely of Objective-C, in which I write software for iPhone and iPad.

When I have time, I enjoy [tinkering](http://github.com/eriklebsen) with Ruby and the more Unix-y aspects of OS X, especially the command line. I am fascinated by the intersection of linguistics between "human" language and source code. Blame the English major.

If you didn't already notice, I favor the Oxford comma.
